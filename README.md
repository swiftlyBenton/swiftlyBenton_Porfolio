I can code... kinda

here are some of my projects!

## **Project 1: Apple Pie: Overview**

The Devlop in Swift Fundamentals Xcode 13 provided by Apple teaches beginners how to use Xcode and Swift to make awesome apps!
One such app is the final project of unit 2, the Apple Pie Project. Basically hangman. Everytime you guess a letter wrong in a certain word, an apple falls of the apple tree. 

**The goal: make an Apple Pie game.**
