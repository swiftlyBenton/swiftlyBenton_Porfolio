I can code... or at least I can try

Here are some of my projects!

## **[Project 1: Apple Pie: Overview](https://github.com/swiftlyBenton/Apple-Pie-Project)**

The Devlop in Swift Fundamentals Xcode 13 provided by Apple teaches beginners how to use Xcode and Swift to make awesome apps!
One such app is the final project of unit 2, the Apple Pie Project. Basically hangman. Everytime you guess a letter wrong in a certain word, an apple falls of the apple tree. 

### **What was the biggest challenge?**

The biggest challenge was getting to text of the button to be added to the string of letters making up the full guessed word.

### **What was the result?**

The end result was a fun to play game that even more fun to make.
